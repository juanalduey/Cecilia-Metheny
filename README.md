# Cecilia-Metheny
This is the custom excel spreadsheet used by my client, Cecilia Metheny, to log income, expenses, and debt. 
To launch the spreadsheet, simply download the excel document "CM Sheet (by Juan Alduey).xlsm." 
Do not download the module files, since these are already embedded in the "CM Sheet" document.
The module folder exists in the repository only for version tracking purposes.

To launch the spreadsheet, simply download the excel document "CM Sheet (by Juan Alduey).xlsm." Make sure you have Microsoft Excel installed on your machine. Do not download the "Modules" folder or anything else in the repository, since everything you need is embedded in "CM Sheet." The "Modules" folder and other documents exists in the repository only for version tracking purposes.

How to use the spreadsheet app: Download the "CM Sheet (by Juan Alduey).xlsm" excel document. Go into the "Income" or "Expenses" tab. Select the next blank row. Add an item by completing each field in that row (some fields have drop-down menus). Use the buttons in the header column for faster input. Use the "Categories and Stats" tab to get sums for each category for any date interval you enter in cells N9 and O9.
